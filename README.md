# The Datalad handbook :orange_book:

This is a living resource on why and - more importantly - *how* to use [DataLad](www.datalad.org).
The rendered version is [here](http://handbook.datalad.org): http://handbook.datalad.org, and is currently
under initial development.

The handbook is a practical, hands-on crashcourse to learn and experience DataLad.
You do not need to be a programmer, computer scientist, or Linux-crank. If you have never touched your computers shell before, you will be fine. Regardless of your background and personal use cases for DataLad, the handbook will show you the principles of DataLad, and from chapter 1 onwards you will be using them.
