One can create a new dataset with 'datalad create [--description] PATH'.
The dataset is created empty
'datalad save [-m] PATH' saves the file (modifications) to history.
Note to self: Always use informative, concise commit messages.
The command 'datalad install [--source] PATH' installs a dataset from e.g. a URL or a path.
If you install a dataset into an existing dataset (as a subdataset), remember to specify the
root of the superdataset with the '-d' option.
A source to install a dataset from can also be a path,
for example as in "datalad install -s ../DataLad-101".
As when installing datasets before, make sure to add a
description on the location of the dataset to be
installed, and, if you want, a path to where the dataset
should be installed under which name.

Note that subdatasets will not be installed by default --
you will have to do a plain
"datalad install PATH/TO/SUBDATASET", or specify the
-r/--recursive option in the install command:
"datalad install -s ../DataLad-101 -r".

A recursive installation would however install all
installed subdatasets, so a safer way to proceed is to
set a decent --recursion-limit:
"datalad install -s ../DataLad-101 -r --recursion-limit 2"

The command "git annex whereis PATH" lists the repositories that have
the file content of an annexed file. When using datalad get to retrieve
file content, those repositories will be queried.
