+Configurations for datasets exist on different levels
+(systemwide, global, and local), and in different types
+of files (not version controlled (git)config files, or
+version controlled .datalad/config, .gitattributes, or
+gitmodules files). With the exception of .gitattributes,
+all these configuration files share a common structure,
+and can be modified with the git config command, but also
+with an editor by hand.
+
+Depending on whether a configuration file is version
+controlled or not, the configurations will be shared together
+with the dataset. More specific configurations and not-shared
+configurations will always take precedence over more global or
+shared configurations.
+
+The git config --list --show-origin command is a useful tool
+to give an overview over existing configurations. Particularly
+important may be the .gitattributes file, in which one can set
+rules for Git-annex about which files should be version-controlled
+with Git instead of being annexed.
