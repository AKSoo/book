$ cat << EOT >> notes.txt
There are two useful functions to display changes between two
states of a dataset: "datalad diff -f/--from COMMIT -t/--to COMMIT"
and "git diff COMMIT COMMIT", where COMMIT is a checksum of a commit
in the history. If only one commit is given, the state of the dataset
at this commit will be compared to the state of the most recent commit.
