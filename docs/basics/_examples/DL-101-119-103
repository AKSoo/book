Note that subdatasets will not be installed by default,
but are only registered in the superdataset -- you will
have to do a "datalad get -n PATH/TO/SUBDATASET"
to install the subdataset for file availability meta data.
The -n/--no-data options prevents that file contents are
also downloaded.

Note that a recursive "datalad get" would install all further
registered subdatasets underneath a subdataset, so a safer
way to proceed is to set a decent --recursion-limit:
"datalad get -n -r --recursion-limit 2 <subds>"

The command "git annex whereis PATH" lists the repositories that have
the file content of an annexed file. When using "datalad get" to retrieve
file content, those repositories will be queried.
