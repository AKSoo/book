it. If no changes happen with a rerun, the command will not be written
to history. Note: you can also rerun a datalad rerun command!

You should specify all files that a command takes as input with an
-i/--input flag. These files will be retrieved prior to the command
execution. Any content that is modified or produced by the command
should be specified with an -o/--output flag. Upon a run or rerun of
the command, the contents of these files will get unlocked so that
they can be modified.

Important! If the dataset is not "clean" (a datalad status output is
empty), datalad run will not work - you will have to save
modifications present in your dataset.
A suboptimal alternative is the --explicit flag, used to record only
those changes done to the files listed with --output flags.
