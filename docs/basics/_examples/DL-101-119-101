Any datalad run command can be re-executed by using its commit shasum as an argument
in datalad rerun CHECKSUM. DataLad will take information from the run record of the original
commit, and re-execute it. If no changes happen with a rerun, the command will not be written
to history. Note: you can also rerun a datalad rerun command!

You should specify all files that a command takes as input with an -i/--input flag. These
files will be retrieved prior to the command execution. Any content that is modified or
produced by the command should be specified with an -o/--output flag. Upon a run or rerun
of the command, the contents of these files will get unlocked so that they can be modified.

Important! If the dataset is not "clean" (a datalad status output is empty),
datalad run will not work - you will have to save modifications present in your
dataset.
A suboptimal alternative is the --explicit flag, used to record only those changes done
to the files listed with --output flags.
