The command 'datalad install [--source] PATH'
installs a dataset from e.g., a URL or a path,
for example as in "datalad install -s ../DataLad-101".

Just as in cloning datasets, you can add a
description on the location of the dataset to be
installed, and, if you want, a path to where the dataset
should be installed under which name.

Note that subdatasets will not be installed by default,
but are only registered in the superdataset -- you will
have to do either a "datalad get -n PATH/TO/SUBDATASET",
a plain "datalad install PATH/TO/SUBDATASET", or specify the
-r/--recursive option in the install command:
"datalad install -s ../DataLad-101 -r" to clone the
subdataset for file availability meta data.

Note that a recursive installation would install all
registered subdatasets, so a safer way to proceed is to
set a decent --recursion-limit:
"datalad install -s ../DataLad-101 -r --recursion-limit 2"
