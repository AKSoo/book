$ cat << EOT >> notes.txt
To update from a dataset with a shared history, you
need to add this dataset as a sibling to your dataset.
"Adding a sibling" means providing DataLad with infos about
the location of a dataset, and a name for it. Afterwards,
a "datalad update --merge -s name" will integrate the changes
made to the sibling into the dataset.
