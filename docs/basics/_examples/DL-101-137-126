$ cat notes.txt
The git config --list --show-origin command is a useful tool
to give an overview over existing configurations. Particularly
important may be the .gitattributes file, in which one can set
rules for git-annex about which files should be version-controlled
with Git instead of being annexed.

It can be useful to use pre-configured procedures that can apply
configurations, create files or file hierarchies, or perform
arbitrary tasks in datasets. They can be shipped with DataLad,
its extensions, or datasets, and you can even write your own
procedures and distribute them. The "datalad run-procedure"
command is used to apply such a procedure to a dataset. Procedures
shipped with DataLad or its extensions starting with a "cfg" prefix
can also be applied at the creation of a dataset with
"datalad create -c <PROC-NAME> <PATH>" (omitting the "cfg" prefix).
