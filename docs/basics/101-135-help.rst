How to get help
---------------

After all of the DataLad-101 lectures and tutorials so far,
you really begin to appreciate the pre-crafted examples the
lecturer provided the students with.

"Nothing really goes wrong, and if so, it's intended", you
acknowledge. "But how does this prepare me for life after
the course? I've seen a lot of different errors and know many
caveats and principles already, but I certainly will mess
something up at one point, and how will I get help then?"

Fortunately, the syllabus has a whole section on that, and on
one lazy, warm summer-afternoon, you flip through it.
