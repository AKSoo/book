DataLad, Re-Run!
----------------

So far, you created a simple ``.tsv`` file of all
speakers and talk titles in the `longnow/` podcasts subdataset.
Let's actually take a look into this file now:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-109
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :lines: 1-30

   $ less recordings/podcasts.tsv

Not too bad, and certainly good enough for the podcast night people.
What's been cool about creating this file is that it was created with
a script within a ``datalad run`` command. Thanks to ``datalad run``,
the output file ``podcasts.tsv`` is associated with the script it
generated.

Upon reviewing the list you realized that you made a mistake, though: you only
listed the talks in the SALT series (the
``Long_Now__Seminars_About_Long_term_Thinking/`` directory), but not
in the ``Long_Now__Conversations_at_The_Interval/`` directory.
Lets fix this in the script. Replace the contents in ``code/list_titles.py``
with the following, fixed script:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-110
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :emphasize-lines: 10

   $ cat << EOT > code/list_titles.py
   # import modules for path operations and pathname pattern expansion
   from os.path import join, basename
   from glob import glob

   # define a path to the podcasts. Note that this is a relative path,
   # pointing from the root of DataLad-101 to the podcasts:

   path = join('recordings', 'longnow',
               '*', '*')        # <-- here is the change!
   # create a list of all file names found under the path
   files = glob(path)
   # define an outfile name:
   outfile = join('recordings', 'podcasts.tsv')

   # loop through all file names and write speaker and title into the file
   with open(outfile, 'w') as f:
       for file in files:
           # extract speaker name
           author = basename(file).split('__')[1] \
               if len(basename(file).split('__')[1].split('_')) > 1 \
               else '__'.join(basename(file).split('__')[1:3])
           # extract title
           title = '_'.join(basename(file).split(author)[-1].split('__')[1:])
           # write speaker and talk title into the file
           f.write(author + '\t' + title + '\n')
   EOT

Because the script is now modified, save the modifications to the dataset.
We can use the shorthand "BF" to denote "Bug fix" in the commit message.

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-111
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ datalad status

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-112
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ datalad save -m "BF: list both directories content" code/list_titles.py

What we *could* do is to run the same ``datalad run`` command as before to recreate
the file, but now with all of the contents:

.. code-block:: bash

   # don't execute this!
   $ datalad run -m "create a list of podcast titles" "python code/list_titles.py"

However, think about any situation where the command would be longer than this,
or that is many months past the first execution. It wouldn't be easy to remember
the command, nor would it be very convenient to copy it from the ``run-record``.

Luckily, a fellow student remembered the DataLad way of re-executing
a ``run`` command, and he's eager to show it to you.

"In order to re-execute a ``datalad run`` command,
find the commit and use its shasum (or a tag, or anything else that Git
understands) as an argument for the
``datalad rerun`` command! That's it!", he says happily.

So you go ahead and find the commit checksum in your history:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-113
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :lines: 1-12
   :emphasize-lines: 8

   $ git log -2

Take that checksum and paste it after ``datalad rerun``
(the first 6-8 characters of the checksum would be sufficient,
here we're using all of them).

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-114
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :realcommand: echo "$ datalad rerun $(git rev-parse HEAD~1)" && datalad rerun $(git rev-parse HEAD~1)

Now DataLad has made use of the ``run-record``, and based on the information in
it re-executed the original command. Because we
updated the script, the output ``podcasts.tsv`` has changed and now contains the podcast
titles of both subdirectories.
You've probably already guessed it, but the easiest way to check whether a ``datalad rerun``
has changed the desired output file is
to check whether the rerun command appears in the datasets history: If a ``datalad rerun``
does not add or change any content in the dataset, it will also not be recorded in the history.

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-115
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   $ git log -1

In the datasets history,
we can see that a new ``datalad run`` was recorded. This action is
committed by Datalad under the original commit message of the ``run``
command, and looks just like the previous ``datalad run`` commit apart
from the execution time.

Note that ``datalad rerun`` works with ``datalad run`` or ``datalad rerun`` commands
(yes, you can ``rerun`` a ``datalad rerun``),
but not with any other type of datalad command in your history
such as a ``datalad save`` on results or outputs after you executed a script.
Therefore, make it a
habit to record the execution of scripts by plugging it into ``datalad run``.

This very basic example of a ``datalad run`` is as simple as it can get, but it
is already
convenient from a memory-load perspective: Now you don't need to
remember the commands or scripts involved in creating an output.
Also, incidentally, we have generated :term:`provenance` information. It is
now recorded in the history of the dataset how the output ``podcasts.tsv`` came
into existence.

Still, this ``datalad run`` was very simple.
The next section will demonstrate how ``datalad run`` becomes handy in
more complex standard use cases: situations with *locked* contents.

But prior to that, make a note about ``datalad run`` and ``datalad rerun`` in your
``notes.txt`` file.

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-120
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ cat << EOT >> notes.txt
   The datalad run command can record the impact a script or command has on a Dataset.
   In its most simple form, datalad run only takes a commit message and the command that
   should be executed.

   Any datalad run command can be re-executed by using its commit checksum as an argument
   in datalad rerun CHECKSUM. DataLad will take information form the runrecord of the original
   commit, and re-execute it. If no changes happen with a rerun, the command will not be written
   to history. Note: you can also rerun a datalad rerun command!

Finally, save this note.

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-108-121
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   datalad save -m "add note on basic datalad run and datalad rerun" notes.txt
