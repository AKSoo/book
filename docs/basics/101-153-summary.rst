Summary
-------

DataLad can

- extract metadata from a dataset, its subdatasets, and the contents of
  (sub)datasets by one or more *extractors* in various formats,
- aggregate it into a metadata representation independent from the original
  data files, and
- add it to and distribute it together with the top-level dataset.

This allows

- comprehensive data discovery without access to or knowledge of individual
  datasets, and
- fast uniform metadata access to any dataset component (individual files,
  subdatasets, the whole dataset) independent of local data availability.
