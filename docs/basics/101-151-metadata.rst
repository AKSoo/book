Extracting metadata
-------------------

.. todo::

   - explain the concept of an extractor
   - showcase metadata extraction in the longnow subdataset
   - talk about the datalad-metalad extension. Possibly have a reference to some yet
     unwritten part about extensions.
   - commands to introduce: meta-dump (instead of metadata), meta-extract, meta-aggregate
   - make a point about metadata for potentially all kinds of domains, find examples on how to
     make use of them, mention Google dataset search.
