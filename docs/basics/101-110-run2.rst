Datalad, Run! [2]
-----------------

In the previous two sections, you created a simple ``.tsv`` file of all
speakers and talk titles in the longnow podcasts subdataset, and you have
re-executed a ``datalad run`` command after a bug-fix in your script.

But these previous ``datalad run`` and ``datalad rerun`` command were very simple.
Maybe you noticed some values in the ``run-record`` were empty:
``inputs`` and ``outputs`` for example did not have an entry. Let's experience when
these two arguments can become necessary.

In our DataLad-101 course we were given a group assignment. Everyone should
give a small presentation about an open DataLad dataset they found. Conveniently,
we settled for the longnow podcasts. We know the dataset quite well already,
and after listening to almost a third of them and enjoying them a lot,
we also want to recommend them to others.

Almost all of the slides are ready, but whats still missing is the logo of the
longnow podcasts. Good thing that this is part of the subdataset, so we can simply
extract it.

The logos were taken from the podcasts meta data information. In a while we
will dive into the metadata aggregation capabilities of DataLad, but for now, let's just
use the logos. They are in the subdataset in
``.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg`` and ``.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_interval.jpg``:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-110-101
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ ls recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/*jpg

For the slides we are preparing we need an image of size 400x400 px, and therefore
let's try to resize the image -- currently, its far too large to fit on a slide.
To resize an image from the command line we can use the Unix command ``convert -resize``.
The command takes a new size in pixel as an argument, a path to the file that should be
resized, and a filename and path under which the resized image will be saved.

To resize one image to 400x400 px, the command would thus be
``convert -resize 400x400 path/to/file.jpg path/to/newfilename.jpg``

Remembering the last lecture on ``datalad run``, you decide to plug this into
``datalad run``. Note that we line break the commands in the upcoming examples
for better readability -- in your terminal, you can always write the commands into
a single line (the ``\`` are linebreaks for your shell).

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-110-102
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   $ datalad run -m "Resize logo for slides" \
   "convert -resize 400x400 recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg recordings/salt_logo_small.jpg"

Oh, crap! Why didn't this work?

Lets take a look at the error message DataLad provides. In general, these error messages
might seem wordy, and maybe a bit intimidating as well, but usually they provide helpful
information to find out what is wrong.

A ``datalad run`` error message has several parts. The first starts after
``[INFO   ] == Command start (output follows) =====``. This is displaying errors that the
terminal command threw: The tool ``convert-im6.q16`` complains that it can't open
the file, because there is "No such file or directory".

The second parts starts after ``[INFO   ] == Command exit (modification check follows) =====``.
DataLad adds an information about a "non-zero exit code". A non-zero exit code indicates
that something went wrong: in shell programming, commands exit with a specific code that indicates
whether they failed, and if so, how. Successful commands have the exit code zero. All failures
have exit codes greater than zero. A few lines lower, DataLad even tells us the specific error
code: the command failed with exitcode 1. In principle, you could go ahead a google what this
specific exit status indicates. However, the solution might have already occurred to you when
reading the first error report: The file is not present.

How can that be? Right, just as the ``.mp3`` files, the ``.jpg`` file content is not present
locally after an install, and we did not ``datalad get`` it yet!

This is where the ``-i``/``--input`` option for a datalad run becomes useful.
The content of everything that is specified as an ``input`` will be retrieved
prior to running the command. Use one ``-i``/``--input`` flag per input: As we have only
one file to retrieve, the command is

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-110-103
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :emphasize-lines: 8, 11, 16
   :realcommand: datalad run --input "recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg" "convert -resize 400x400 recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg recordings/salt_logo_small.jpg"

   $ datalad run -m "Resize logo for slides" \
   --input "recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg" \
   "convert -resize 400x400 recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg recordings/salt_logo_small.jpg"
   # or shorter:
   $ datalad run -m "Resize logo for slides" \
   -i "recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg" \
   "convert -resize 400x400 recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg recordings/salt_logo_small.jpg"


Cool! You can see in this output that prior to the data command execution, DataLad did a ``datalad get``.
This is useful for several reasons. For one, it saved us the work of manually
getting content. But moreover, this is useful for anyone whom we might share the
dataset with: With an installed dataset one can very simply rerun ``datalad run`` commands
if they have the input argument appropriately specified. It is therefore good practice to
specify the inputs appropriately. Note that ``datalad get`` will only retrieve content if
it is not yet present, all input already downloaded will not be downloaded again.

.. container:: toggle

   .. container:: header

      **Addition: What if there are several inputs?**

   Often, a command needs several inputs. In principle, every input gets its own ``-i``/``--input``
   flag. However, you can make use of :term:`globbing`. For example,

   .. code-block:: bash

      datalad run --input "*.jpg" "COMMAND"

   will retrieve all ``.jpg`` files prior to command execution.

Looking at the resulting image, we realize however that 400x400 is still a tiny bit to small.
Maybe we should try to resize it to 450x450, and see whether that looks better.

Note that we can't use a ``datalad rerun`` for this: if we want to change that dimension option
in the command, we have to define a new ``datalad run`` command.

To establish best-practices, lets specify the input even though it is already present:


.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-110-104
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :emphasize-lines: 10
   :realcommand: datalad run --input "recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg" "convert -resize 450x450 recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg recordings/salt_logo_small.jpg"

   $ datalad run -m "Resize logo for slides" \
   --input "recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg" \
   "convert -resize 450x450 recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg recordings/salt_logo_small.jpg"
   # or shorter:
   $ datalad run -m "Resize logo for slides" \
   -i "recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg" \
   "convert -resize 450x450 recordings/longnow/.datalad/feed_metadata/logo_salt.jpg recordings/salt_logo_small.jpg"


Oh wtf... What is it now?

A quick glimpse into the error message shows a different error than before:
The tool complains that it is "unable to open" the image, because the a "Permission [is] denied"

We haven't seen anything like this before, and we need to turn to our lecturer for help ...
