   functionality in DataLad 0.12.0, but the state the handbook was in at this

**Welcome to the DataLad handbook!**
------------------------------------

This handbook is a living resource about why and -- more importantly -- *how* to
use DataLad. It aims to provide novices and advanced users of all backgrounds
with both the basics of DataLad and start-to-end use cases of specific
applications. If you want to get hands-on experience and learn DataLad, the *Basics*
part of this book will teach you. If you want to know what is possible, the
*use cases* will show you. And if you want to help others to get started with DataLad,
the `companion repository <https://github.com/datalad-handbook/course>`_ provides
`free and open source teaching material <teaching.html>`_ tailored to the handbook.

Before you read on, please note that the handbook is based on **DataLad version 0.12**,
but the section :ref:`install` will set you up with what you need if you currently do
not have DataLad 0.12 or higher installed. If you're new here, please start
the handbook `here <intro/philosophy.html>`_.

.. important::

   The handbook is currently in beta stage.
   If you would be willing to provide feedback on its contents, please
   `get in touch <https://github.com/datalad-handbook/book/issues/new>`_.
